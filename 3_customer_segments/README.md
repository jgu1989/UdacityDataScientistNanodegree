# Identify Customer Segments with Arvato

In this project, unsupervised learning techniques will be applied to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
